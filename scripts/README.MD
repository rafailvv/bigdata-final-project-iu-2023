**ALS Model with Features (Genres):**

This model has taken into account the 'genres' of the movies along with other data like 'userid', 'movieid', and '
rating' to predict the rating a user would give a movie. The 'prediction' column contains the predicted ratings
generated by the ALS model, given the features.

**ALS Model without Features:**

In the second dataset, the model doesn't use additional features like movie genres for prediction. It only uses '
userid', 'movieid', and 'rating'. Like in the first case, the 'prediction' column shows the ratings predicted by the
model.

In both models, the goal is to minimize the difference between the actual and predicted ratings. If the model is
perfect, the predicted ratings would match the actual ratings given by the users. Tuning the hyperparameters of the ALS
model, incorporating more relevant features
